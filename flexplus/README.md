* Full width page
* 4 footer widget areas
* Orbit for WordPress, ZURB's image and content slider tailored for WordPress, with the ability to add different sliders to different pages.
* A growing list of shortcodes for columns, buttons and panels
* Clean, validated code
* Two sidebars (one on the right & one on the footer)
* A little snippet that 'hides' the address bar on the iPhone
